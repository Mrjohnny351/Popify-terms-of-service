    <h1>Popify Terms of Service</h1>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By inviting or using Popify, you agree to these Terms of Service. These terms apply to all users of the bot, including server owners, administrators, moderators, and members interacting with the bot in any capacity.</p>

    <h2>2. Use of Services</h2>
    <p>You agree to use Popify only for lawful purposes and in a manner that does not violate Discord’s Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. Misuse of the bot for abuse, harassment, spam, or illegal activities is strictly prohibited.</p>

    <h2>3. Developer Rights & Moderation Authority</h2>
    <p>We may:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Investigate suspicious or harmful behavior associated with the bot.</li>
      <li>Take moderation actions including temporary or permanent bans on users, guilds, or IPs if they are found to be:</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Abusing the bot to trigger rate limits or downtime</li>
      <li>Attempting to exploit or reverse-engineer the bot</li>
      <li>Promoting hate speech, harassment, violence, or NSFW content</li>
      <li>Circulating, distributing, or encouraging explicit/nude content</li>
      <li>Impersonating Popify staff or misleading users</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="warning">⚠️ Global Enforcement:</p>
    <p>In severe cases, we reserve the right to take global actions such as bans, kicks, or forced name changes across all mutual guilds where Popify is present. This enforcement applies particularly when individuals are found to be severely circulating nude/NSFW content or engaging in serious violations, with the intent to stop harmful distribution chains and ensure a safe environment across Discord.</p>

    <h2>4. Investigative Access Clause</h2>
    <p>In severe cases involving:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Malicious exploitation of the bot</li>
      <li>Coordinated abuse</li>
      <li>Evidence tampering or disruption of services</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We reserve the right to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Programmatically create an invite and temporarily join a server to investigate abuse or technical disruption</li>
      <li>Gather evidence or validate rate-limit attacks</li>
      <li>Only take this action under justified suspicion to protect the safety of Popify and the Discord ecosystem</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By using Popify, you acknowledge and agree to this clause, which exists solely to protect users and ensure a secure service.</p>

    <h2>5. Content and Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All code, features, responses, and assets provided by Popify are the intellectual property of Popify Development. You may not reproduce, distribute, or replicate any part of the bot without written permission.</p>

    <h2>6. Service Termination</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access to Popify at any time, with or without notice, for any reason — especially for violations of these terms or Discord policies.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>These Terms of Service may be updated at any time. Major changes will be announced in our support server. Continued use of the bot implies agreement with the most current version.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact & Support</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about these Terms, you can reach out to our team via our support server:</p>
